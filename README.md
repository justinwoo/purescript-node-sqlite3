# purescript-node-sqlite3 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/justinwoo/purescript-node-sqlite3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/justinwoo/purescript-node-sqlite3)

Really basic wrapper for [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)

Of course, this is nowhere near done, so please suggest improvements and additions!


## Installation

```sh
npm install
```


## Usage

[See the tests!](test/Main.purs)

```haskell
launchAff do
  conn <- newDB "./data"

  exists <- (\rows -> 1 == length rows)
    <$> queryDB conn "SELECT 1 from foods where name = ?" ["gulerodskage-med-fl√∏dest"]
  log $ "do we have this?: " <> (show exists)

  closeDB conn
```


## Other libraries

In addition to this base library, you might also consider one of these libraries to give you some additional modeling and type safety capabilities:
